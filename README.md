# HDE
A GoLang challenge to find sum of squares without using For loop.

It is created for the Global Internship Program for HDE, INC.

Prompt as below:
Description
We want to calculate a sum of squares of some integers, excepting negatives
The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100)
Each of the following N test cases consists of one line containing an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by X integers (Yn, -100 <= Yn <= 100) space-separated on the next line
For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers excepting negatives, and print the calculated sum to the output. No blank line between test cases
(Take input from standard input, and output to standard output)
Rules
Write it in Go Programming Language
Your source code must be a single file (package main)
Do not use for statement
You may only use standard library packages
